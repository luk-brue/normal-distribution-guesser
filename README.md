This is a quick R shiny app to train your eye in identifying normally distributed data.

The approach is really simple. 
1. Data is sampled from a random distribution (currently one of Uniform, Normal and bimodal normal distribution)
2. Histogram is shown of that data
3. User supplies their guess
4. Guess is evaluated
5. User clicks and restarts the whole process

I wrote this to be used in a `learnr` tutorial about regression
